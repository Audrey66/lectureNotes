HW 1 - due Tuesday, January 27
    be sure to explain your reasoning when asked
    on logic puzzles, should be clear why your answer is the only  
        one


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- where to find examples from class

Today:

- More with logical reasoning and puzzles
- Begin logic gates and truth tables
- Evaluating logical statements

All ints.

if (x < 3 || y > 4) {
    statements1;
}
else if (x < 5 && y == 7) {
    statements2;
}
else {
    statements3;
}

first is false, so x >= 3 && y <= 4
second has to be true, so x < 5 && y == 7
    but conficts with y<=4

--> is it possible for "statements2" to execute?7

no

More with knights and knaves.

knights: each full statement that they make is true
knave: each full statement must be false




You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, "Bill would tell you that I am a knave."

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?


(How might we simplify everything?)

    sarah - bill is a knight
    bill- mae is a knight
    mae- " bill would say i'm a knave"

IF sarah is knight: bill must be a knight
    mae would be knight 
    doesnt work because bill said mae was knight

IF sarah is knave: bill is knave, mae is knave
    bill would lie and say mae is knight, mae lies and says bill would be knave

    This one works

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?

sunday- lion lied, should be truth
tues/wed/fri/sat- whoever lied lied the day before, but should be lying 
monday- uni tells truth mon/sun, should lie 
thurs- lion truthfully says lied wed, uni lies about lying


the day is thursday

////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

(So they both tell the truth on Sunday.)

You don't know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: "I'm Tweedledum." 
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee."

Which is which? What day is it?

has to be sunday. every other say, they would give same name.

they are who they say



//////////////////////////////////

In-class quiz





//////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don't know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


(we know one is lying, one is telling truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

Who gets the rattle?

    IF 1st is telling truth, tweedledee gets rattle 
        second is lying, so they are Tweedledum
        first is tweedledee, gets rattle.
    
    IF 1st is lying, tweedledum owns rattle
        second is truth, so they are tweedledee
        first is tweedledum, who gets the rattle
    
    first twin gets rattle

Who is who?

not enough information

Based on Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: "The portrait is in this casket."
Silver casket: "The portrait is not in this casket."
Lead casket: "The portrait is not in the gold casket."

    could all be false, or only one is true

Where is the portrait?

    IF in gold: gold and silver would be true, so not true

    IF in silver: only one statement is true, this works

    IF in lead: two true statements, doesnt work

it is in the silver

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."


Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."

    nothing in may or june, because it has the day 18 & 19
    cant be 14, so leaves only july 16


When is it?

july 16

idk what just happened

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧   and (&&)
∨   or (inclusive or ||)
¬   not (!)
→   implies (if/then ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)

    only three: and, or, not

gates still used to design circuits


why do we care about equivalent circuits?

    can simplify to save money, space

what about programming?

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q  #  p ∧ q
--------------
T T  #    T 
T F  #    F
F T  #    F 
F F  #    F


OR:

p q  #  p ∨ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    T
F T  #    T
F F  #    F


NOT:

p  # ¬p
--------
T  # F
F  # T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #   T 
T F  #   F    -broken promise
F T  #   T 
F F  #   T  -doesnt mean anything, didnt come up


/////////////////////////////////////////

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

    if/then statement

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)


p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

    (pvq) ^ -(p^q)
    drawing stuff, if you dont remember your fucked idk
    top is left, bottom is right (of the inputs for the gate)

/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?

just take it step by step

Graphically build circuits:

https://logic.ly/demo/


//////////////////////////////////////

Evaluating logical statements.

Basic operations:

∧ - AND
∨ - OR (inclusive or)
¬ - NOT
→ - IMPLIES

////////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q ∧ r.

--> what operation do we do first?



Order of operations

In math?

(); ^x; *,/; +,-


For logic statements:

From highest (happens first) to lowest (happens last) precedence:

(), ¬(!), ^(&&), V(or), →

////////////////////////////////////////////////

Given this statement:

    ¬p ∨ q ∧ r

Add () to show the order of operations.

(¬p) V (q ^ r)


Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F

F

///////////////////////////////////////////

Next:
- more with order of operations
- bigger truth tables
- parse trees
- begin propositional logic
